                <h2 class="ind1">Draft Beers</h2>
                <h4 class="p3">
                    <strong> Many of our draft beers are locally brewed and delivered fresh </strong>
                </h4>

                <h3><strong>Gritty's Pub Style (ME)</strong></h3>
                <p>Original Pub Style is a light copper-colored medium-bodied with a nice dry bite at the finish. A subtle combination of Cascade and Willamette hops give this ale a fine floral aroma and a slightly fruity aftertaste. The taste captures the freshness of a hand-crafted brew pub ale that goes right from the conditioning tank to your glass! Original Pub Style is a year-round release available in six and twelve packs all over the great state of Maine, and on draft at Gritty's Portland and Freeport brew pubs.</p>

                <h3><strong>Gritty's Vacationland (ME)</strong></h3>
                <p>
                    You can't put summer in a bottle, but we may have come close! When the weather gets warm we roll out our summer seasonal, Vacationland Summer Ale. Vacationland is an Extra Special Golden Ale that's light in color but full-bodied, with a snappy hop finish. A bit of extra time in the conditioning tank rounds out and mellows the ale. We use generous portions of pale malt with just a touch of wheat malt to give VSA unique flavor that?s richer than most summer brews. Cascade leaf hops add a delicate and forward hop character as well. It's the perfect brew for all things summer. Available April-August on draft, in 6 and 12-packs, 22 oz bottles and 5-liter mini-kegs.
                </p>

                <h3><strong>Baxter Stowaway IPA (ME)</strong></h3>
                <p>Bold, complex flavors with a solid malt backbone and assertive hop profile, along with cold conditioning, give this beer its crisp, clean, hoppy finish. Deep amber-to-orangish in color, Stowaway pours with a nice, creamy head; a huge hop aroma of citrus, pine and grapefruit notes; and a big, complex, and intense hop flavor from the 5 different hop varieties and double-dry-hopping procedure used in making this beer. The malt flavor up-front turns dry and crisp; Stowaway is full-bodied but with a dry finish and pleasant, long-lasting, hop aftertaste. This I.P.A. definitely leaves you wanting more.</p>

                <h3><strong>Black Bear Gearhead (ME)</strong></h3>
                <p>Gearhead Ale is a malt forward dark amber ale. There are caramel and roasted notes, and a slight English hop character. This is a very smooth beer that leaves you wanting another sip to explore the subtle complexities.</p><br>

                <h3><strong>Black Bear Pail Ale (ME)</strong></h3>
                <p>Pail Ale is a hoppy American pale ale. Large late American hop additions give a big aroma and flavor balanced with a sweet malty backbone for a very drinkable pale ale.</p><br>

                <h3><strong>Angry Orchard Hard Cider (MA)</strong></h3>
                <p>A crisp and refreshing cider, It's fresh apple aroma and slightly sweet, ripe apple flavor make it hard to resist.</p><br>

                <h3><strong>Sam Adams Boston Lager (MA)</strong></h3>
                <p>Samuel Adams Boston Lager helped lead the American beer revolution, reviving a passion for full-bodied brews that are robust and rich with character.  Since 1984, Samuel Adams Boston Lager has used only the finest hand-selected ingredients to create this perfectly balanced, complex and full-bodied original brew.</p><br>

                <h3><strong>Sam Adams Seasonal (MA)</strong></h3>
                <p>Seasons change, so do tastes. that's why we carry the most current seasonal Sam Adams brew.</p><br>

                <h3><strong>Alagash White (VT)</strong></h3>
                <p>Our interpretation of a traditional Belgian wheat beer. Brewed with a generous portion of wheat and spiced with coriander and Curacao orange peel, this beer is fruity, refreshing and slightly cloudy in appearance.</p><br>

                <h3><strong>Long Trail IPA (VT)</strong></h3>
                <p>Real India Pale Ale (IPA), as it was first brewed in the days of the British Empire, was not the carefully filtered brew that we call IPA beer today. The first IPAs were unfiltered and featured extra hops and higher strength as a preservative for the long trip from England to the colony of India. Our Traditional IPA ale is naturally carbonated, dry-hopped & unfiltered like the old days.</p><br>

                <h3><strong>Long Trail Double Bag (VT)</strong></h3>
                <p>This malty, full-bodied Double Ale is also known as “Stickebier” – German slang for “secret brew”. Long Trail Double Bag was originally offered only in our brewery taproom as a special treat to our visitors. With an alcohol content of 7.2%, please indulge in moderation. The Long Trail Brewing Company is proud to have Double Bag named Malt Advocate’s “Beer of the Year” in 2001. Malt Advocate is a national magazine devoted to “expanding the boundaries of fine drinks”. Their panel of judges likes to keep things simple, and therefore of thousands of eligible competitors they award only two categories: “Imported” and “Domestic”. It is a great honor to receive this recognition.</p>

                <h3><strong>Guinness (Ireland)</strong></h3>
                <p>Swirling clouds tumble as the storm begins to calm, settle, breathe in the moment, then break through the smooth, light head to the bittersweet reward. Unmistakeably GUINNESS® beer, stout, or draught , from the first velvet sip to the last, lingering drop. And every deep-dark satisfying mouthful in between.
                    Pure beauty. Pure GUINNESS®</p>

                <h3><strong>Bud Light(NH)</strong></h3>
                <p>Bud Light’s crisp, clean refreshing taste and superior drinkability make it popular everywhere from backyard BBQs to black-tie soirees. Its light-bodied brew comes with a fresh and subtle hop aroma, delicate malt sweetness and crisp finish for the ultimate refreshment.</p><br>

                <h2 class="ind1">Bottled Beers</h2>

                <h3><strong>Narragansett Lager</strong></h3>
                <p> A classic American lager and the workhorse of the Gansett stable. Available all year long in bottle, can and on tap.</p>
                <h3><strong>Budweiser</strong></h3>
                <p>Known as "The King of Beers," Budweiser was first introduced by Adolphus Busch in 1876 and it's still brewed with the same high standards today. Budweiser is a medium-bodied, flavorful, crisp American-style lager.

                <p>Bud Light’s crisp, clean refreshing taste and superior drinkability make it popular everywhere from backyard BBQs to black-tie soirees. Its light-bodied brew comes with a fresh and subtle hop aroma, delicate malt sweetness and crisp finish for the ultimate refreshment</p>
                <h3><strong>Amstel Light</strong></h3>
                <p>As the first importer to introduce light beer in 1980, we led the American light beer revolution with delicious Amstel Light. At just 95 calories per bottle, its unique mixture of barley and hops delivers a full – never diluted – flavor that’s just as tasty as regular beer.</p>
                <h3><strong>Coors Light</strong></h3>
                <p>Cold Coors Light is good. Super Cold Coors Light is better. 2-Stage Cold
                    Activation lets you know when your Coors Light goes from Cold to Super
                    Cold so you can enjoy the World’s Most Refreshing Beer at its best...at
                    the peak of refreshment. Is cold beer that important? You be the judge.</p>
                <h3><strong>Twisted Tea</strong></h3>
                <p>Since 2001, our Tea brewmasters (yes, their job is as cool as it sounds) have been committed to brewing a hard iced tea that not only tastes like real iced tea but also delivers an incredibly smooth and refreshing drinking experience.</p>
                <h3><strong>Corona</strong></h3>
                <p>The unmistakable color.
                    The one-of-a-kind taste.
                    The unparalleled flavor of relaxation.</p>
                <h3><strong>Heineken</strong></h3>
                <p>Heineken is brewed using the same method developed in 1873 and takes the better part of a month to brew - around twice as long as regular beer. That extended "lagering" gives Heineken its distinctive flavor and clarity.</p>
                <h3><strong>Buckler (Non-alcoholic)</strong></h3>
                <p> Made by Heineken this non-alcoholic brew is actually pretty good. </p><br>
