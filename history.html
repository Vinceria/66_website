            <p class="p2"><strong>Building History</strong></p>
            <p>Before 66 Main Street’s time as a place to come for dinner, this building was a beloved blacksmith’s forge serving the townsfolk of Blue Hill.  Clarence Snowman acquired the property in 1888 and built the current structure.  He continued to work here until he sold the property to Charles F. Wescott in 1910, whose blacksmith shop was a landmark in the village for half a century.  In his earlier years, Charlie kept busy putting runners on sleds, rims on cars and carriages, shoes for horses and oxen, and making repairs on all sorts of ironwork.  Some of 66’s customers today still remember seeing Charlie hard at work at the forge years ago.</p>
            <p class="p3">As the need for this type of work diminished, Charlie turned to decorative forging, a trade in which he found himself to be very skillful.  In his later years, he called his shop the “Hammer & Tongs,” and some of his original works still grace the building of 66 Steak & Seafood today.  His hardware, weather vanes, signs and other items of this sort became very well known, and he continued to work at the forge until the time of his death in 1959.</p>
            <p class="p2"><strong>Fritz & Our Fare</strong></p>
            <p>Since that time, the building at 66 Main Street has served as a location for restaurants, with 66 Steak & Seafood opening in June of 2011.  After working for several years as an architect in New York City, Business Owner & Chef Alfred “Fritz” Knoll embarked to open his own restaurant, pursuing a lifelong passion for food that started during his childhood in his grandmother’s kitchen and led to several positions in fine-dining kitchens.  With the town of Blue Hill’s need for a full-fledge steakhouse as well as a late night dining option, Fritz from the start wanted to make 66 a unique restaurant that offered options to anyone, from burgers and nachos to filet mignon and fine-dining fare.</p>
            <p class="p3">Today, 66 Steak & Seafood has become just that—a place to come for a uniquely eclectic dining experience.  Whether you’re craving Italian, Mexican, Cajun, Thai, or sometimes even sushi, 66 is a place where there is something for everybody.  We are open all the way until midnight many nights of the year (including our full menu from the kitchen), running specials everyday that provide even more variety for our patrons.  Peppercorn pork chops with a French onion soup reduction and blueberry compote, coconut-crusted Mahi Mahi over ginger & basil rice, and a flambéed fig & cheddar risotto are just a tiny sample of all the creative and delicious entrees 66 has to offer.</p>
              <p class="p2"><strong>66 Steaks!</strong></p>
              <p>And as for steaks, you can be sure that you’ll be getting the most tender and flavorful cuts in Downeast Maine.  All of our meats are cut by Fritz in house and undergo a double aging process, starting with a 60-day dry age through Certified Angus Beef and ending with a 45-day oil curing here at 66 Steak & Seafood.  This along with the inherent quality of Certified Angus Beef provides our customers the best experience a steakhouse can offer.  While most restaurants serve only Angus grade beef, 66 wants to ensure that you receive the highest quality steaks on the market, serving Certified Angus Beef which meets and surpasses the quality of USDA Prime.  We are very proud to be one of the only Gold Member Certified Angus Beef restaurants in the state of Maine north of Portland.  Try one of our medium rare Delmonicos, a rare Pub steak, or a savory slow-roasted Prime Rib, and you’ll see what the rave is all about.</p>
